YuuYuu Restaurant LP

🤤 The idea: to create a tasty-looking restaurant website. I've added some Japanese elements to celebrate 3 months of learning Japanese, and I've recreated and used the logo from the '3 Body Problem' series because I liked the show so much!

📝 What I've used: pure HTML, CSS sprinkled with JS.

🧠 What I wanted to reinforce: CSS flex layout, HTML forms, simple CSS animations, JS event listeners, and DOM manipulation.

🚀 Next steps: another project, this time using libraries; cooperative work.
