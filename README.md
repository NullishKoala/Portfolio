# Portfolio

Welcome to my frontend portfolio. Below you'll find my own small projects I build for fun as to keep my frontend coding skills fresh.
They are organised from oldest to latest.
I use vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, often design my own graphics, write my own copy and utlise opensource fonts and icons.


5. Mandalorian landing page

   

4. YuuYuu restaurant landing page

YuuYuu Restaurant LP

🤤 The idea: to create a tasty-looking restaurant website. I've added some Japanese elements to celebrate 3 months of learning Japanese, and I've recreated and used the logo from the '3 Body Problem' series because I liked the show so much!
📝 What I've used: pure HTML, CSS sprinkled with JS.
🧠 What I wanted to reinforce: CSS flex layout, HTML forms, simple CSS animations, JS event listeners, and DOM manipulation.
🚀 Next steps: another project, this time using libraries; cooperative work.
🎯 Resources:

ChatGPT for text content,

3. Join a roller skating club

💫 Built with pure HTML + CSS<br>
💅 Images (created in Canva) and ✍ copy are entirely my own, as always.<br>
💡 Inspiration came from the countless roller skating events, roller derby games, tournaments, tripleheaders, and championships I've participated in, attended, volunteered at, and organized throughout my sports career. 🎖🏆<br>

Here it is:

2. Pick A Pickle<br>

💽 vanilla JS, HTML, CSS: I played with canvas and picking different colours of the markers for drawing.<br>
🖼 image and ✍ copy are my own creations,<br>
🥒 inspired by Rick and Morty series.<br>

Here's a screenshot:
