# Portfolio

Welcome to my frontend portfolio. Below you'll find my own small projects I build for fun as to keep my frontend coding skills fresh.
They are organised from oldest to latest.
I use vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, design my own graphics, write my own copy and utlise opensource fonts and icons.

3. Join a roller skating club

💫 Built with pure HTML + CSS<br>
💅 Images (created in Canva) and ✍ copy are entirely my own, as always.<br>
💡 Inspiration came from the countless roller skating events, roller derby games, tournaments, tripleheaders, and championships I've participated in, attended, volunteered at, and organized throughout my sports career. 🎖🏆<br>

Here it is:

2. Pick A Pickle<br>

💽 vanilla JS, HTML, CSS: I played with canvas and picking different colours of the markers for drawing.<br>
🖼 image and ✍ copy are my own creations,<br>
🥒 inspired by Rick and Morty series.<br>

Here's a screenshot:
