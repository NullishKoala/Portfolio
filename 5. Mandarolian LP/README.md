5. Mandalorian landing page
   
3 days late, but May the 4th be with you! To celebrate, I've created this landing page to honor one of my favourite characters from the SW universe -The Armorer 🛠️❤️‍🔥

🌠 Theme: Star Wars, The Mandalorian series;
🔨 HTML, Bootstrap + bits of customization with CSS;
🖌️ copy and images mostly from [Star War's fandom page](https://lnkd.in/dZT4DmgN);
🖼️ icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons).

What I am most proud of after finishing this project:
🦾 being able to more precisely estimate the time to complete a project,
🦾 being more confident with using Bootstrap, understanding when it could be very useful, and when custom styling works better,
🦾 being able to apply web design principles (such as color theory, alignement, white space, layout, consistency). I can see how that improves my new projects.

😻 I'm incredibly fulfilled seeing my creative vision come to life through the development of this website. It's so rewarding to witness the transformation of an idea into something concrete. 😻
